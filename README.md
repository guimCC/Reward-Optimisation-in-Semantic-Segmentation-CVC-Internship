## Project Overview

This project aims to implement reward optimization in the semantic segmentation domain of computer vision. The primary objective is to leverage this technique as a supplementary tool for Domain Adaptation to enhance the model's metric scores.

The theoretical approach is inspired by the paper ["Tuning Computer Vision Models with Task Rewards"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08242), which outlines a general methodology applicable to similar tasks.

The implementation is conducted within the [MMSegmentation framework](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a platform known for its depth in runtime modifications and widespread use in the scientific community.
